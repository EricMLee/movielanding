            <h2>THIS IS THE REALM OF THE <span>DEMONS</span></h2>
            <p>After a demon attack leaves his family slain and his sister cursed, Tanjiro embarks upon a perilous journey to find a cure and avenge those he's lost.</p>
            <!-- <h2>Put something here please</h2>
            <p>Ever since the death of his father, the burden of supporting the family has fallen
              upon Tanjirou Kamado's shoulders. Though living impoverished on a remote mountain,
                the Kamado family are able to enjoy a relatively peaceful and happy life. One day,
                Tanjirou decides to go down to the local village to make a little money selling charcoal.
                  On his way back, night falls, forcing Tanjirou to take shelter in the house of a strange man,
                  who warns him of the existence of flesh-eating demons that lurk in the woods at night.
            </p><p>
              When he finally arrives back home the next day, he is met with a horrifying sightâ€”his whole
              family has been slaughtered. Worse still, the sole survivor is his sister Nezuko, who has
                been turned into a bloodthirsty demon. Consumed by rage and hatred, Tanjirou swears to avenge
                his family and stay by his only remaining sibling. Alongside the mysterious group calling themselves
                  the Demon Slayer Corps, Tanjirou will do whatever it takes to slay the demons and protect the remnants
                  of his beloved sister's humanity.</p> -->
